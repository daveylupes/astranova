Goblin.","description":"The Troll Bot takes a different approach to scalping BTC compared to Goblin. For starters it has a higher risk to reward (1.4 to 1). Pair that with a 64% win rate since Jan 2021 and that leads to the back test results below. The other major benefit to Troll Bot is that it tends to perform well in market conditions that are difficult for Goblin and Gremlin so it's a nice hedge against Goblin/Gremlin drawdowns.","lang":"en","created":"2023-05-25T21:45:23.000Z","updated":"2023-08-23T17:21:39.000Z"}],"buyLimit":0,"isExchangeLimited":false,"prices":[{"id":241,"price":1.99,"flow":"PRODUCT_FLOW_UNSPECIFIED","isMaster":false,"isReferred":false,"created":"2024-03-13T11:04:44.091Z","updated":"2024-03-13T11:04:44.091Z"}],"publicId":"troll-bot","images":[{"file":{"remoteFileName":"64eccd285baed_Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 12.36.17 PM.png"},"type":"backtest","sourceId":272},{"file":{"remoteFileName":"64eccd2870a26_Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 12.36.26 PM.png"},"type":"backtest","sourceId":272},{"file":{"remoteFileName":"069d7b46d8292d21.webp"},"type":"main"},{"file":{"remoteFileName":"a3f3045c916ca59f.webp"},"type":"icon"}],"businessId":6,"priority":0,"promote":false,"strategy":{"tradePair":{"id":730,"name":"BTCUSD","isInverse":true,"tradedAsset":{"id":24,"name":"usd","udfName":"USD","displayName":"US Dollar","icon":"usd.svg","isTraded":true},"baseAsset":{"id":1,"name":"bitcoin","udfName":"BTC","displayName":"Bitcoin","icon":"btc.svg","isTraded":true},"tradeTrigger":{"id":1,"notation":"BTCUSD"}},"name":"goblin-troll-bot","strategyBackTests":[{"id":272,"name":"Bitcoin","version":"1","created":"2023-08-28T16:36:56.000Z","updated":"2023-08-28T16:36:56.000Z"}],"publicId":"goblin-troll-bot","maxTraded":0,"maxLeverage":10,"isDca":false,"created":"2023-05-25T21:45:23.000Z","updated":"2024-03-13T10:12:28.430Z","signal":{"id":92}},"strategies":[{"tradePair":{"id":730,"name":"BTCUSD","isInverse":true,"tradedAsset":{"id":24,"name":"usd","udfName":"USD","displayName":"US Dollar","icon":"usd.svg","isTraded":true},"baseAsset":{"id":1,"name":"bitcoin","udfName":"BTC","displayName":"Bitcoin","icon":"btc.svg","isTraded":true},"tradeTrigger":{"id":1,"notation":"BTCUSD"}},"name":"goblin-troll-bot","strategyBackTests":[{"id":272,"name":"Bitcoin","version":"1","created":"2023-08-28T16:36:56.000Z","updated":"2023-08-28T16:36:56.000Z"}],"publicId":"goblin-troll-bot","maxTraded":0,"maxLeverage":10,"isDca":false,"created":"2023-05-25T21:45:23.000Z","updated":"2024-03-13T10:12:28.430Z","signal":{"id":92}}],"signal":{"id":92},"signals":[{"id":92}],"business":{"publicId":"goblin","name":"Goblin Bots"}},{"name":"enigma","category":"PRODUCT_CATEGORY_STRATEGY","isPopular":false,"descriptions":[{"id":282,"name":"ENIGMA","shortDescription":"Bespoke advanced swing/scalp ethereum strategy by Trader Origin","description":"Welcome to ENIGMA, a bespoke trading algorithm by Trader Origin, designed specifically for Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts.

The term Byzantine fault tolerance is derived from a hypothetical scenario called the “Byzantine General’s Problem”.\n\nThis hypothetical scenario was developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid failure of a distributed system, the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable. It uses a planned attack on an enemy city by four Byzantine generals. These generals and their armies are each occupying a different side of the city and so are totally separated from each other, making direct, coordinated communication impossible. In order to plan their attack – or retreat – they must use their own messengers to handle communication and so they each send their messengers to share their plan with each other. \n\nAll decentralized networks (distributed ledger, such as a blockchain) have independent nodes that act like the byzantine generals in the hypothetical situation above.\n\nThese nodes must come to an agreement, or consensus, on things like: transactions submitted to the network, the ordering of those transactions, and the state of the network itself. These network nodes are likely separated from each other geographically, virtually, architecturally, and sometimes even ethically.\n\n ","lang":"en","created":"2024-03-14T20:08:09.824Z","updated":"2024-06-04T23:27:41.000Z"}],"buyLimit":0,"isExchangeLimited":false,"prices":[{"id":358,"price":2.17,"flow":"PRODUCT_FLOW_UNSPECIFIED","isMaster":false,"isReferred":false,"created":"2024-06-04T23:28:33.604Z","updated":"2024-06-04T23:28:33.604Z"}],"publicId":"Byzantine","images":[{"file":{"remoteFileName":"74c872be4c0e89c3.webp"},"type":"backtest"},{"file":{"remoteFileName":"5b9b9b2cc7e91482.webp"},"type":"backtest"},{"file":{"remoteFileName":"0d25f3dd8ebcedb7.webp"},"type":"main"},{"file":{"remoteFileName":"99d01674329dc03f.webp"},"type":"icon"}],"businessId":4,"priority":0,"promote":false,"strategy":{"tradePair":{"id":54,"name":"HBARUSDT","isInverse":false,"tradedAsset":{"id":33,"name":"hedera","udfName":"HBAR","displayName":"Hedera","icon":"hbar.svg","isTraded":true},"baseAsset":{"id":18,"name":"usdt","udfName":"USDT","displayName":"USD Tether","icon":"usdt.svg","isTraded":true},"tradeTrigger":{"id":22,"notation":"HBARUSD"}},"name":"Byzantine","publicId":"Byzantine","maxTraded":0,"maxLeverage":4,"isDca":false,"created":"2024-03-14T20:08:09.834Z","updated":"2024-06-13T19:15:21.159Z","signal":{"id":2122}},"strategies":[{"tradePair":{"id":54,"name":"HBARUSDT","isInverse":false,"tradedAsset":{"id":33,"name":"hedera","udfName":"HBAR","displayName":"Hedera","icon":"hbar.svg","isTraded":true},"baseAsset":{"id":18,"name":"usdt","udfName":"USDT","displayName":"USD Tether","icon":"usdt.svg","isTraded":true},"tradeTrigger":{"id":22,"notation":"HBARUSD"}},"name":"Byzantine","publicId":"Byzantine","maxTraded":0,"maxLeverage":4,"isDca":false,"created":"2024-03-14T20:08:09.834Z","updated":"2024-06-13T19:15:21.159Z","signal":{"id":2122}}],"signal":{"id":2122},"signals":[{"id":2122}],"business":{"publicId":"elevate","name":"Elevate Trading"}},{"name":"AVALITH","category":"PRODUCT_CATEGORY_STRATEGY","isPopular":false,"descriptions":[{"id":285,"name":"AVALITH","shortDescription":"AVALITH Hybrid scalp/swing by Trader Origin","description":"Welcome to AVALITH, a bespoke trading algorithm by Trader Origin, crafted specifically for AVAX enthusiasts.
